Project Title: E-commerce Store with User Authentication (Python)

Description:
Developed a console-based E-commerce Store application in Python that simulates a real-world online shopping experience. The system includes a user authentication module and a store management system with a shopping cart feature.

Key Features:

User Authentication (Auth Class)

Implemented registration and login system with credentials stored in a local text file (users.txt).

Used file handling in Python for persistent storage of user accounts.

Handled scenarios like duplicate user registration and invalid login attempts.

Product Management (Product Class)

Created a structured representation of store items using a Product class with attributes like id, name, and price.

Ensured each product is uniquely identifiable using product.id (similar to database primary keys).

Shopping Cart & Store Operations (Store Class)

Implemented a cart system (self.cart) where users can add, remove, and view selected products before checkout.

Displayed available products with unique IDs, names, and prices.

Enabled checkout functionality, showing the final total and clearing the cart upon order placement.

Menu-driven Interface

Built an interactive, loop-driven menu for easy navigation.

Options include viewing products, managing the cart, and completing checkout.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Python OOP concepts (Classes, Objects, Methods, Encapsulation).

File handling (open, readlines, write) for data persistence.

String operations (strip, split) for input parsing and validation.

Error handling (try-except) for robust program execution.

Logical problem-solving and simulation of a real-world shopping workflow.

Impact:
This project highlights how fundamental Python concepts can be applied to build a mini real-world system. It demonstrates knowledge of object-oriented programming, authentication, file handling, and user interaction, making it a strong foundation for more advanced projects like web-based e-commerce platforms.
